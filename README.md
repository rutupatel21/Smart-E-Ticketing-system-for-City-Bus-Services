# Bus Ticket generation ANDROID PHP MYSQL
Bus ticket android app using Android Studio,PHP,MySQL



 This is a simple project, no extra stuff created as part of a mini project in college
 There are two apps. one for passenger to create a ticket and the ticket id will be saved in the database. The ticket will be saved in the form of a QR code. The conductor app is a seperate app which the conductor can use to scan the QR code.


For further info, you can refer the projectreport document which contains most of the info needed.

Thank you.
